# Financial Market Impact Analysis of COVID-19

This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on local financial markets, including stock exchanges, bond markets, and foreign exchange (FX). It utilizes historical market data and statistical analysis techniques to quantify the effects of the pandemic and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Project Proposal

The project proposal outlines the goals, objectives, approach, methodology, desired outcomes, and intended working plan of the project. It provides a comprehensive overview of the research objectives and the methods used to achieve them.

## Code

The code directory contains Python scripts for data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization. The main script `market_analysis.py` fetches historical market data, performs EDA, applies statistical models, and generates visualizations to analyze market behavior before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Results and Initial Inferences

The results directory contains visualizations and initial inferences derived from the analysis of market data. These results provide insights into the impact of the pandemic on local financial markets and highlight key trends and patterns observed in the data.
