Impact of Covid 19 on Financial markets

# Financial Market Impact Analysis of COVID-19

This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on local financial markets, including stock exchanges, bond markets, and foreign exchange (FX). It utilizes historical market data and statistical analysis techniques to quantify the effects of the pandemic and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.


## Code

The code directory contains Python scripts for data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization. The main script `impact_of_covid_on_markets.ipynb` fetches historical market data, performs EDA, applies statistical models, and generates visualizations to analyze market behavior before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.


### Usage

To use the project code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the main script `impact_of_covid_on_markets.ipynb` to perform the analysis.

### Results

The results of the analysis are presented in the form of visualizations and initial inferences. These results provide insights into the behavior of local financial markets before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Updated Features

- Expanded data collection to include a wider array of financial markets and key indicators.
- Enhanced statistical analysis using advanced models such as ARIMA, GARCH, and VAR.
